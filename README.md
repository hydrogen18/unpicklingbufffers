This is used to benchmark the performance of the `cStringIO`, `StringIO`,`cPickle`, and `pickle` modules when depickling from a buffer object. To run and plot the results

```
python unpicklingBuffers.py
gnuplot plot
```

Two plots `linear.png` and `log.png` are generated. 

My results from from this benchmark are included.
